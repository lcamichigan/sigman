# Sigman Numbering

To compute a volume number for new issues of _The Sigman_:

1. Subtract 1933 from the year of the issue.

2. If the month of the issue is before August, also subtract 1.

For example, the volume number of the May 2013 issue is:

2013 – 1933 – 1 = 79

The volume number of the December 2013 issue is:

2013 – 1933 = 80

Issue numbers start at 1 and increase by 1 in a particular volume.

The strategy for computing a volume number for new issues comes from this
strategy to estimate the volume number of any issue:

1. Subtract 1929 from the year of the issue.

2. If the year of the issue is after 1994, also subtract 4.

3. If the month of the issue is before August, also subtract 1.

This strategy gives correct volume numbers for known issues of _The Sigman_ from
Nov 1935 to May 1943. (Note that incorrect volume numbers were printed in issues
from Jan 1941 to May 1943.)
